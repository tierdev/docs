Tier is a comprehensive system for SaaS billing and pricing,
which is easier to set up than rolling your own logic, and
enables safe and changes to pricing schemes in the future.

With Tier, pricing plan _definition_ is separated entirely from
feature usage logic, so your _code_ doesn't have to change when
your pricing does.  A single source of truth about your pricing
model means that everything is kept in sync.
